Rift is a secure real-time file sending solution powered by WebRTC. It sends files through LAN connection whenever possible, making file transfers speedy. If LAN connection is not possible, Rift uses relays to bypass firewalls. A default relay is available, with a global monthly transfer limit of 500 MB. Maximum supported file size is 5 GB.

## Rift Cloud\*

With Rift, you will be easily able to deploy your own relay and signaling servers, and configure them to your liking. Rift Cloud also supports saving your preferences if you often send files.
